### My Projects:

#### Machine Learning to Predict if a car purchased at auction is a lemon ([View](https://jovian.com/zthoufiqz55/dont-get-kicked))

- Cleaned & analyzed Don’t get Kicked dataset with 73k rows and 34 columns to predict Bad Buy
- Trained Logistic models, random forests, decision tree using scikit learn
- RandomForestClassifier performed better accuracy and with hyperparameter tuning achieved 89% on the validation dataset.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis on FIFA 2022 World Cup Using Python: ([View](https://github.com/thoufiqz55/EDA))

- Worked with FIFA 2022 dataset from Kaggle containing 23,921 Entries across 25 Features
- Created visualizations (scatter plots, violin charts, heatmaps, etc.) using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Observed that USA has the highest win streak among all teams & won 253 matches in the tournament
